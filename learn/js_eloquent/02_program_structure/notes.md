## expressions & statements

**expressions**
- fragments of code procudes a value is an expression
- any value is an expression (`22`, `"word"`)
- an expression within parnetheses is an expression
- an expression with applied with operators is an expression

> hence the statements are just expressions with a semicolon after it

so bindings allow program to hold its internal state for other operations

USE VARIABLES

```js
let a = 3;
```

- the `let` key word indicate its a binding, following bu a name then the value
- `var` and `const` could also be used to create bindings

> bindings are variables

## the environment

- the collection of bindings and their their values thath exist at a given time is the *environment*
- is this the scope??
- more like runtime environment

## control flow 

order of operation within nested functions

## conditional execution

if statements

if else
