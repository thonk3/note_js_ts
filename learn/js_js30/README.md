# JS in 30 with React

More or less this is a [little challange](https://javascript30.com/) for me to practice somewhat getting better at at JS/React.
I'll also use this to have a look at [SemanticUI]() since MaterialUI is a big oof

the weird thing is probably translating vanilla js into react, shouldnt be too hard.
